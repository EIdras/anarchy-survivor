## How to play ?
We ***strongly recommend*** you to use a **game controller** üéÆ to play the game, as the controls for mouse/keyboard are not yet correctly implemented.
### Controls :
- Left stick to move your character around
- Right stick to aim towards enemies
- Use any bumper or trigger to drop a grenade at your position (it will explode after a short time, you can check the cooldown at the right bottom corner of your screen)

Your goal is to survive as long as possible while fighting hordes of enemies. Collect experiences cubes by walking near them, and level up to unlock new powerups !
